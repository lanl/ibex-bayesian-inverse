TITLE: Computer Model Calibration for Large-Scale Spatially Distributed Counts

ABSTRACT:
The Interstellar Boundary Explorer satellite (IBEX) was launched by NASA in 2008 and collects data that can help reveal the structure of the heliosphere, the boundary between our solar system and interstellar space. In particular, IBEX detects energetic neutral atoms (ENAs) coming from the heliosphere. Space science theorists have developed a variety of competing models for ENA generation and propagation, and they want to use IBEX data to evaluate the relative strength of evidence for different models. This problem fits naturally within the framework of statistical computer model calibration. However, this problem also comes with some unique challenges, such as non-continuous data, limited but data-intense computer model runs and field measurements, nonstationarity of the response surface, and spatially correlated observations. We present a framework for model calibration that builds upon the canonical Kennedy and O'Hagan approach and incorporates scaled Vecchia-approximated Gaussian processes.
