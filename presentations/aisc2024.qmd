## Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX)
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="45%"}
- Satellite launched into Earth's orbit in 2008
- Sensors record the number of energetic neutral atoms (ENAs) that enter the apparatus
- Maps the entire sky over a period of six months
- ENAs from sources other than the heliosphere are counted by the instrument
- Counts are noisy and irregular
- Response surface is extremely non-stationary
- Dataset is large (> 16,000 points per map)

## The Heliosphere
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="45%"}
- **Heliosphere:** the bubble formed by the solar wind that encapsulates the solar system
- **Energetic Neutral Atoms (ENAs):** particles formed within the heliosheath with high energy and no charge
- **Project Goal:** examine the interaction between the solar wind and interstellar medium to better understand the makeup of the heliosphere
